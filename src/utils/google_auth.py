"""Google OAuth for Calendar and Gmail, per WhatsApp user.

Each user connects their own Google account through a personal link; the
resulting tokens are stored in that user's profile row. The one shared
token file from the single-account era is kept only as a fallback for the
owner numbers (BUSINESS_DATA_PHONES), so the client's existing connection
keeps working while other users connect their own.
